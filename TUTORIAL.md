# TUTORIAL
Step 1. Find the green button at the top right of the page and click it. ![Opera Snapshot_2023-06-29_132119_github com](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/67e30d18-6c35-4737-a291-96acb7d52249)
Step 2. Click on download ZIP at the bottom of the drop-down bar. ![Opera Snapshot_2023-06-29_132256_github com](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/e1d5e004-838f-4540-a456-8ea0b87f6f64)
Step 3. Find the ZIP file in your downloads folder and extract it. Windows should be able to extract it natively but I use PeaZIP. ![Screenshot 2023-06-29 133138](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/2ada062a-0987-4369-b51a-e6e2912c61a2)
Step 4. Once the ZIP file is extracted, you should see a new folder with the same name as the ZIP. Open the folder and you should see this. ![Screenshot 2023-06-29 133252](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/f1c3bc99-fa26-44b4-98ff-eec8029debf0)
Step 5. Now head to the Opera GX extensions page and enable developer mode. You should see a button that says "Load Unpacked". Click this. ![Opera Snapshot_2023-06-29_133333_opera](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/3fec3de3-3c68-4fa5-bd94-ce38bd166085)
Step 6. Find the folder you extracted in Step 3 and click "Select Folder" at the bottom of the file explorer window. ![Screenshot 2023-06-29 133627](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/92a15132-aac0-4613-ae7e-c0c6bc2898e2)
Step 7. The Paint Warfare extension should be at the top of your extension list. It should also read "Version 1.1 by NotWhopper". ![Opera Snapshot_2023-06-29_133659_opera](https://github.com/NotWhopper/Paint-Warfare-Opera-GX-Mod/assets/137898415/9db4a2ed-31e0-40e7-a431-8176e967c994)
